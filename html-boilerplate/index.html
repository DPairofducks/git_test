        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>This is really cool. I'm building a web page!</p>
        <p>I need to use paragraph tags to start new paragraphs</p>
        <!-- This is hard to read. Is there a proper way to linebreak within the editor? -->
        <p>This is a <strong>really</strong> long paragraph section. We're going to add bold (strong) and italic (em) text to it. This will let me add <em>emphasis</em> to break it up.</p>
        <!-- <strong> and <em> tags are the same as <b> and <i> tags, but they help with accessibility -->
        <h2>Search engines use headings. This is not just an aesthetic choice.</h2>
